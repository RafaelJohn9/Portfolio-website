                <h4 className='font-extrabold'>What is your approach to problem-solving?</h4>
                <p className='italic pl-10'>
                    I usually start by understanding the problem thoroughly,
                    then I break it down into smaller, 
                    manageable tasks. I then solve each task one at a time.

                <h4 className='font-extrabold'>What is Backend development and why did you decide of  to major in it?</h4>
                <p className='italic pl-10'>
                Backend development involves the creation and maintenance of the server-side logic,
                 databases, and APIs that power web applications.
                  It's essentially the "behind-the-scenes" work that makes a website or web application function properly.
                 Backend developers handle tasks such as server management, database integration, 
                 business logic implementation, security, and scalability.
                 </p>
                 <br/>
                <p className='italic pl-10'>
                 As for why I decided to major in it is due to
                 Interest in problem-solving: 
                 Backend development often involves complex problems related to data processing,
                system architecture, and performance optimization.
                 For individuals like me who enjoy solving puzzles and tackling challenges, 
                 backend development can be intellectually stimulating.

                    Start by learning the basics of a programming language, 
                    then build small projects to apply what you've learned. 
                    Don't be afraid to ask for help and always keep learning.
