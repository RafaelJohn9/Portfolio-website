                <p className='italic pl-10'>
                    I usually start by understanding the problem thoroughly,
                    then I break it down into smaller, 
                    manageable tasks. I then solve each task one at a time.

                    Start by learning the basics of a programming language, 
                    then build small projects to apply what you've learned. 
                    Don't be afraid to ask for help and always keep learning.
